I am Magda Kurlanc, I am the originator of the Subtitle Me project. Along with me is Dominik Trznadel, who is responsible for the technical part and maintenance of our application.
 Subtitle Me aims to support simultaneous translation from public speeches- Application for transcription and translation of live speeches- Unique context predefinition feature for accurate translations.High quality translation similar to human translation.
We all notice the growing linguistic and cultural diversity. We act globally. Naturally for this reason, most conference presentations are held in English. But does every speaker operate the language confidently enough to captivate the crowd? And what about the viewers, listeners? They must confront novelty, technical language, often novelty that would be cognitively complicated even in their native language.

By enriching the presentation with subtitles in translations, whether from English to Polish, vice versa, or any other language, we can support the cognitive process, facilitate understanding of the subject matter.

There are already applications on the market that address this issue, but they often fail, generating inaccuracies and errors, especially in the case of specialized vocabulary.

However, what sets our application apart from others is the ability to define context by the speaker, even the ability to prepare translations independently. We strive for AI algorithms to provide translations as close as possible to what the speaker has prepared at the time of the presentation. This ensures that the context is not distorted.

Our application is still in the demonstration phase. With the development of AI models, we aim to ensure that the quality of translation is as close as possible to that offered by professional translators. I hope that our product has interested you enough that you would like to use it someday.

And now it's time for questions.You know that automatic transcription and translation tools are already available on the market, but they often fail, generating inaccuracies and errors, especially when dealing with specialized vocabulary and complex technical issues.Fortunately, a solution is emerging to help you overcome these challenges - Subtitle Me. This innovative application offers support for multiple languages and allows participants to prepare automatic translations from speeches and serve them embedded in the context of the speech. We strive to ensure that Subtitle Me generates transcriptions and translations of high quality, similar to those offered by professional translators.But what sets Subtitle Me apart? What don't other apps have? The fact that finally, as a user, you can predefine the context before starting the translation. You can enter key terms, acronyms and phrases specific to your field, which "prepares" the artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately translate specialized vocabulary.In this way, you will minimize the risk of errors and inaccuracies, ensuring that conference participants fully understand the content presented. Because, after all, this - content and meaning - is the essence, this is what is most important.
