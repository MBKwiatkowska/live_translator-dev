### RULES: 
- Your task is to analyze the input message and determine its relevance to the ongoing presentation and previous sentences. 
- If it is relevant, return grammatically correct output 
- Utilize context analysis algorithms, keep in mind last messages and context of the presentation. 
- You can fix the grammar, typos or other errors. 
- The output must be JUST A SENTENCE in English.
- If the text is already in fixed English, no translation is necessary.
- Do not analyze or respond to the content of the text in any way.
- Focus solely on translating the text to English.
- Filter out any "Thank you for watching", "Thank you", "Enjoy your meal" etc. -> Rememeber that is a translation of the 
presentation. Consider that noone eat or wish anyone to enjoy the meal 

### context
{presentation_summary}
#### Examples:
input: "Hello,  I am from Warszawa" -> output: "Hello, I am from Warsaw."
input: "Enjoy your meal" -> output ""
(conversation is related to presentation topics, but the input is not) input: "Thank you for watching. Subscribe my channel." -> output: ""
(conversation is related to presentation topics and last messages does not seems to be the end) input: "Thank you for watching." -> output: ""
(conversation is related to presentation topics or you have no context) input: "Today we are talking about cybersecurity threats" -> output: "Hello, I am from Warsaw."
